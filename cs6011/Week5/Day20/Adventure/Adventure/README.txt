collaboration with: 
Felix Ye:
-Room: Library
-Item: fireplace, painting


I did my adventure room/item with Felix Ye
I did the Throne Room with a torch that you can pick up as well as a chest that can be opened once instructions from Felix's room have been seen
Felix did a Library with a fireplace that is lit up by the torch from my Throne Room.
Once the fire place is lit up, it reveals a painting that shows directions for opening the chest in the throne Room
Once the chest is opened it reveals a pile of gold inside that you can retrieve
