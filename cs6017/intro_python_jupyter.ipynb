    "**`Ctrl+Enter`** runs the current cell.  \n",
    "**`Shift+Enter`** runs the current cell and jumps to the next cell.   \n",
    "**`Alt+Enter`** runs the cell and adds a new one below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In command mode:\n",
    "**`h`** shows a help menu with all these commands.  \n",
    "**`a`** adds a cell before the current cell.  \n",
    "**`b`** adds a cell after the current cell.  \n",
    "**`dd`** deletes a cell.  \n",
    "**`m`** as in **m**markdown, switches a cell to markdown mode.  \n",
    "**`y`** as in p**y**thon switches a cell to code.  \n",

    "## Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "When you [run code](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html), the code is actually executed in a **kernel**. You can do bad thinks to a kernel: you can make it stuck in an endless loop, crash it, corrupt it, etc. And you probably will do all of these things :). So sometimes you might have to interrupt your kernel or restart it. Use the \"Kernel\" menu to restart the kernel, re-run your notebook, etc.  We'll be using Python mostly for this class, but you can actually install Kernels for a bunch of different languages [see here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, before submitting a homework or a project, make sure to `Restart and Run All`. This will create a clean run of your project, without any side effects that you might encounter during development. We want you to submit the homeworks **with output**, and by doing that you will make sure that we actually can also execute your code properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storing Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks contain both, the input to a computation and the outputs. If you run a notebook, all the outputs generated by the code cells are also stored in the notebook. That way, you can look at notebooks also in non-interactive environments, like on Github.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook itself is stored in a rather ugly format containing the text, code, and the output. This can sometimes be challenging when working with version control."
