    <h1>Ramble On</h1>
    <div class="content">
    Leaves are falling all around, It's time I was on my way.
    Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay.
    But now it's time for me to go. The autumn moon lights my way.
    For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way.

    <h1>Burn the Witch</h1>
    <div class="content">
    Stay in the shadows
    Cheer at the gallows
    This is a round up
    This is a low flying panic attack
    Sing a song on the jukebox that goes
    Burn the witch
    Burn the witch
    We know where you live
